# 🌐 Web Server in C

Welcome to the **Web Server in C** project! This repository showcases a simple yet effective web server implemented entirely in the C programming language. It's designed to help you understand the fundamentals of web server operations, including handling HTTP requests and responses.

## 🚀 Features

- **HTTP Request Handling** Processes incoming HTTP GET requests and serves the appropriate response
- **Static File Serving** Capable of delivering static content like HTML, CSS, and image files to client
- **Concurrent Connections** Utilizes multi-threading to manage multiple client connections simultaneousl
- **Logging** Keeps track of client requests and server responses for monitoring and debugging purpose
